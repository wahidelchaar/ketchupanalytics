Every row in this SAS dataset corresponds to a brand choice occasion between Heinz and Hunts ketchup products. The purpose of this project is to provide marketing analytics insights to Heinz in the following ways: 
1- Determine which promotional methods are effective in influencing consumer brand choice.
2- Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to choose Heinz based on prices and promotional methods. This model is to be used to send coupons to potential Heinz customers at minimum misclassification cost.

The dataset consists of the following variables:
Heinz: 1 if Heinz was purchased, 0 if Hunts was purchased
PriceHeinz: Price of Heinz at the time of purchase
PriceHunts: Price of Hunts at the time of purchase
DisplHeinz: 1 if Heinz had a store display, 0 if Heinz did not have a store display at the time of purchase
